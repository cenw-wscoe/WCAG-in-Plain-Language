            <h2>Frequently asked questions (<abbr title="Frequently Asked Question">FAQ</abbr>)</h2>
            <h3>1. What is <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>?</h3>
            <p>Technology, equipment, or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment for which the principal function is the creation, conversion, duplication, automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmissions, reception, or broadcast of data or information.</p>
            <p>Examples of ICT include Web pages, electronic content, telecommunications products, computers, software including mobile applications, information kiosks and transaction machines, videos, information technology services, and multifunction office machines which copy, scan and fax documents.</p>

            <h3>2.	What policy or legislation requires the consideration of inclusion of accessibility requirements into procurement? </h3>
            <p>The following list of policies and legislation contain direction regarding accessible <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> goods and services: </p>
            <p><b><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-0.6/FullText.html">Accessible Canada Act (<abbr title="Accessible Canada Act">ACT</abbr>)</a></b><br>The purpose of the Accessible Canada Act is to make Canada barrier-free in areas under federal jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>The Act outlines how to identify and remove accessibility barriers and prevent new barriers, under federal rule, including in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Built environments (buildings and public spaces);</li>
                <li>Employment (job opportunities and employment policies and practices);</li>
                <li>Information and communication technologies (digital content and technologies used to access it);</li>
                <li>Procurement of goods and services;</li>
                <li>Delivering programs and services;</li>
                <li>Transportation (by air as well as by rail, ferry and bus carriers that operate across a provincial or international border);</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p><b><a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14494">Treasury Board Contracting Policy</a></b></p>
            <p>4.2.26.1 Include accessibility criteria when specifying requirements for goods and services; and </p> 
            <p>4.2.26.2 Ensure that deliverables incorporate accessibility features.</p>
            <p>4.2.27 Consistent with trade agreements and comprehensive land claims agreements, if the department determines that it is not appropriate to include accessibility criteria as part of goods/services specifications, or if it is unable to obtain goods or services that comply, the client or technical authority must ensure that clear justification is on file.</p>
    
            <p><b><a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12452">Policy Framework for Information and Technology</a></b></p>
            <p>2.2 Stewardship of information and technology encompasses fiscal responsibility in meeting client needs and expectations both internal and external to government. This includes ensuring that technical solutions and information management practices are respectful of individual privacy and that information is secure from unauthorized access. Both information and technology must be developed, deployed, and managed in appropriate formats. This facilitates usability by all those accessing government services, including persons with disabilities. Additionally, it ensures the support of the provision of services and information in both official languages, while respecting individual and collective rights.</p>
    
            <p><b><a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755">Policy on Management of Information Technology</a></b></p>
            <p>5.1.3 IT services address barriers to engagement with Canadians while meeting their changing needs.</p>
    
            <p><b><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html">Government of Canada Digital Standards </a></b></p>
            <p>Key components include:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Design with users;</li>
                <li>Iterate and improve frequently; </li>
                <li>Work in the open by default; </li>
                <li>Use open standards and solutions; </li>
                <li>Address security and privacy risks; </li>
                <li>Build in accessibility from the start; </li>
                <li>Empower staff to deliver better services; </li>
                <li>Be good data stewards; </li>
                <li>Design ethical services;</li>
                <li>Collaborate widely.</li>
            </ul>        
    
            <h3>3.	Isn’t the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601"><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> web accessibility standard</a> sufficient to address <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> accessibility issues?</h3>
            <p>No, the existing Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Web Accessibility Standard (<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0">WCAG 2.0</abbr>) is not sufficient to ensure all information and communications technology products, services and digital content are accessible as it: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Covers only externally facing web sites;</li>
                <li>Does not cover other aspects including hardware, software, other digital content; </li>
                <li>Not designed as a complete accessible information and communications technology standard; </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is currently inconsistent procurement, development and use of information and communications technology hardware and software across the Government of Canada, all with varying accessibility ratings. </p>
    
            <h3>4.	Why adopt the <a href="http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard/technical-requirements/">Harmonized European Standard – EN 301 549</a> accessibility requirements for <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> products and services standard? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is harmonized with other standards including Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 and Section 508 (United States). </li>
                <li>It is developed by an acknowledged technical standards development organization using a recognized standards development process. Adopting it is a relatively straight-forward process. </li>
                <li>It has been adopted internationally by all 28 EU member states and several other countries including Norway, Serbia, Albania, Macedonia, Switzerland and Australia. </li>
                <li>It is regularly reviewed for updates (minimum every five years). </li>
                <li>A 2018 Employment and Social Development Canada study, based on comprehensive private and public sector engagement, recommended harmonization with the EN 301 549 standard.</li> 
                <li>A federal interdepartmental working group has also suggested using it as a starting point. Accessible ICT procurement Policy-final report, prepared by inclusive Design Research Centre, Ontario College of Art and Design University, March 31, 2018. </li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>5.	Why <abbr title="Employment and Social Development Canada">ESDC</abbr> is implementing the EN 301 549 as an accessibility standard in absence of a Treasury Board Secretariat approved standard?</h3>
            <p><abbr title="Employment and Social Development Canada">ESDC</abbr> is committed to providing leadership to procure accessible <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> goods and services and supporting the goal of inclusive by design, accessible by default. <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> procurement as an opportunity to show leadership including: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working with the Interdepartmental Working Group on ICT Accessibility to ensure Government of Canada efforts are coordinated </li>
                <li>Engaging industry to assess maturity level and compliance with accessibility standards </li>
                <li>Embedding accessibility into ESDC procurement governance process </li>
                <li>Developing a framework to build accessibility requirements into ICT procurements, based on agreed standard. </li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>6.	What are the tools and processes available for <abbr title="Employment and Social Development Canada">ESDC</abbr> team to procure accessible <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>?</h3>
