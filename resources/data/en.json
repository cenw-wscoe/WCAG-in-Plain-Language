            "Details": "Heading levels should create a hierarchical structure of the document. Logically, therefore heading levels should not be skipped. The reason that WCAG allows levels to be skipped is: <blockquote cite='https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/655#issuecomment-474105510'> <p>Currently correct hierarchical nesting is a best practise but not a WCAG failure. That was carefully negotiated during the creation of WCAG 2.0 by companies that have content coming from many sources who could not guarantee hierarchy, and at the time many screen reader users just press H. H, H to move through headings, or pulled up a list of headings without specific concern about the level.</p> <footer>David MacDonald's comment on <cite><a href='https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/#issuecomment-474105510'>H42 missing appropriate hierarchical level condition · Issue #655 · w3c/wcag</a></cite>.</footer> </blockquote> <p>In summary: the reason WCAG doesn't <em>require</em> non-skipped headings is because of <em>exceptional</em> circumstances.
