	            <li>Reading this documentation on <a href="hhttp://intranet.canada.ca/hr-rh/ve/dee-deme/piae-peia-eng.asp">Guide to Planning Inclusive meetings <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i><span class="wb-inv">

				<p><strong>Important notes to consider:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Keep in mind that people who are culturally Deaf, will prefer to have sign language interpreters because their first language is likely <span lang="fr">Langage des signes Qu&eacute;b&eacute;coise</span> (<abbr>LSQ</abbr> - French) or American Sign Language (<abbr>ASL</abbr> &ndash; English), but do not assume this. Ask them what their preferred accommodation would be.</li>
					<li>There are people who have become deaf later in life and have not learned to communicate by <abbr>ASL</abbr> or <abbr>LSQ</abbr>. Usually, people who communicate by sign language are those who were born Deaf and did not learn how to speak at a young age.&nbsp;</li>

        	<h2>Accessibility solutions to consider when organizing a meeting or event:</h2>
	        <section>
	        	<h3>Communication Access Real-Time (<abbr>CART</abbr>)</h3>
		        <ul>
		            <li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-live-captions-in-a-teams-meeting-4be2d304-f675-4b57-8347-cbd000a21260">Microsoft Teams offers English Live Captioning</a> with no additional costs</li>
		            <li>French live Captioning can be offered from the following service providers; keep in mind there are costs involved with these service providers</li>
		            <li><a href="https://www.chs.ca/service/captioning-services">CART from the Canadian Hearing Services</a> (<abbr>CHS</abbr>): Staff at CHS will be able to provide you with information on the logistics in providing CART for audio Conferences. Keep in mind there is a cost for this service:
		                <ul>
		                    <li>CART from <a href="https://neesonsreporting.com/neesons-cart-captioning-services/">Neesons Court Reporting</a></li>
		                    <li>CART from <a href="https://www.natcapcan.ca/about-us.php">National Captioning Canada</a></li>
		                    <li>Cost ($600 - $3,000) we reach out to companies that offer this service and see who is available to support our event.</li>
		                    <li>Once a company is found (typically the lowest bidder/quote), you need to provide the teleconference numbers so they can listen to the Simultaneous Interpreters.</li>
		                    <li>Two contracts must be created: one writes in French and one writes in English</li>
		                    <li>The company that offers CART, will sends a link for those that participate in the event via webcast (online), they can follow as well.</li>
		                </ul>
		            </li>
				</ul>
	        </section>
			
			<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
				<p><strong>Important note to consider:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure that you discuss the possibility of having transcripts from the Communication Access Real-Time (<abbr>CART</abbr>) provider.</li>
					<li>Transcripts can be a valuable additional service for people with hearing loss (there is typically no additional cost for transcripts). However, if you want to share the transcripts with others, then the <abbr>CART</abbr> providers will charge an additional cost because they correct errors the <abbr>CART</abbr> stenographer may have made. If the additional cost for transcripts is not paid, the CART user cannot share the transcripts with others.&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
	        <p>Sign Language Interpreters booked through the Translation Bureau at Public Services and Procurement Canada (no cost) - however, there are cancellation fees and rush fees:</p>
	        <ul>
	            <li>You can book the Sign Language interpreter here by sending an email to <a href="mailto:BTInterpretationLO.TBOLInterpretation@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca">BT Interpretation</a> (from Public Works)</li>
	            <li>They will send you a form to fill out</li>
	            <li>These are booked months in advance to avoid any fees. I believe its 16 days prior to the event to book and cancel. Otherwise, they charge you approximately $1,940.00</li>
	        </ul>
	        
	        <p>If your meeting is an open-door type meeting where you have no way of knowing the needs of your participants, then you should provide as many accommodations as possible, including but not limited to CART (Communication Access Real-Time), sign language interpreters in both American Sign Language (ASL - English) and Langue des signes Qu&eacute;b&eacute;coise (LSQ - French).</p>
	        
	        <p>The Web Standards Center of Expertise (CoE) team in Innovation Information and Technology Branch (IITB) have recently tested <strong>Zoom</strong> for accessibility and it passed their tests. Keep in mind Zoom is not an official approved software yet. Therefore, we can only speak about its accessibility and use but not other fields like security and performance. It has worked well with us although we have not yet tried the paid version with the captioning enabled.</p>
