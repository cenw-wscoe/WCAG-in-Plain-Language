        <div class="alert alert-info mrgn-tp-lg"><p>Special thanks to <strong>Kristina England</strong>, Digital Experience and Accessibility Specialist in Higher Ed, for putting all this content together with information provided by <strong><a href="https://trustees.iu.edu">Indiana University's Board of Trustees</a></strong> and other sources.</p></div>

        <h2>Global Optimization Settings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Disable Group HD </strong>under Settings &ndash; Meeting &ndash; In Meeting (Advanced)<strong>.</strong> HD video takes up more bandwidth so it will impact the viewing experience for anyone that has reduced bandwidth at home. If you do not wish to disable this feature across your Zoom instance, you can also unlock the feature to allow users to disable it at the individual account level.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Videos to Record Locally </strong>under Settings &ndash; Recording. Videos will record to the presenter&rsquo;s computer and process immediately. The Cloud recording service is currently encountering up to 72-hour delays, which will create issues for faculty sending out courses to students in a timely manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable the </strong><strong>Show a Join from your browser link setting </strong>under Settings &ndash; Meetings &ndash; In Meeting (Advanced). This is a workaround for participants who are unable to download, install, or run applications.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Enable Closed Captioning Settings</h2>
        <p>While closed captions may not be requested for all meetings, it will be important to have these settings enabled so that presenters can use them as needed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enable Closed Captioning</strong> under Settings &ndash; Meeting &ndash; In Meeting (Advanced).</li>
            <li><strong>Enable Save Captions</strong> under Settings &ndash; Meeting &ndash; In Meeting (Advanced).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Enable nonverbal feedback</h2>
        <p>Nonverbal feedback allows participants who are muted to raise their hand when they want to ask a question. This can be used along with the Chat feature but both features should be available to presenters. You can enable nonverbal feedback under Settings &ndash; Meeting &ndash; In Meeting (Basics).</p>
        <h2>Ensure the Custom Meeting ID feature is &nbsp;Unlocked</h2>
        <p>With faculty using Zoom for courses, having a personal meeting ID will provide a standard way for faculty members to communicate. These features should be unlocked should faculty (or employees) decide to use a custom Meeting ID or Link for classes and meetings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unlock Use Personal Meeting ID (PMI) when scheduling a meeting</strong> under Settings &ndash; Meeting &ndash; Schedule Meeting.</li>
            <li><strong>Unlock Use Personal Meeting ID (PMI) when starting an instant meeting </strong>under Setting &ndash; Meetings &ndash; Schedule Meeting.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Notification Settings</h2>
        <p>Ensure the following email notifications are unlocked so that presenters can determine if they want to use the feature or not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>When attendees join meeting before host</strong> under Settings &ndash; Meeting &ndash; Email Notifications. This feature can create unexpected email noise as participants may click the meeting link days in advance to test, so the presenter will get notifications when participants are testing a link.</li>
            <li><strong>When a meeting is cancelled</strong> under Settings &ndash; Meeting &ndash; Email Notifications. This feature can be extremely helpful even if a presenter sends out an email that the meeting was cancelled as it can reinforce that message.</li>
        </ul>
