		<p>Important to consider that people who are culturally Deaf, may prefer to have sign language interpreters
			because their first language is likely American Sign Language (ASL &ndash; English) or Langage des signes
			Qu&eacute;b&eacute;coise (LSQ - French), but do not assume this. Ask them what their preferred accommodation
			would be. There are people who have become deaf later in life and have not learned to communicate by ASL or
			LSQ.</p>
		<p>Accessibility solutions to consider when organizing a meeting or event;</p>
		<h2>Communication Access Real-Time (CART)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a
					href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-live-captions-in-a-teams-meeting-4be2d304-f675-4b57-8347-cbd000a21260">Microsoft
					Teams offers English Live Captioning</a> at no additional costs</li>
			<li>French live Captioning can be offered from the following service providers (keep in mind there are costs
				involved with these service providers);</li>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.chs.ca/service/captioning-services">CART from the Canadian Hearing Services</a>
					- staff at CHS will be able to provide you with information on the logistics in providing CART for
					audio Conferences. Keep in mind there is a cost for this service.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>CART from <a href="https://neesonsreporting.com/neesons-cart-captioning-services/">Neesons Court
						Reporting</a>.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>CART from <a href="https://natcapcan.ca/about-us/">National Captioning Canada</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The cost can range from $600 - $3,000.</li>
			<li>Reach out to companies that offer this service and see who is available to support the event. Once a
				company is found (typically the lowest bidder/quote), you need to provide the teleconference numbers so
				they can listen to the Simultaneous Interpreters for bilingual events. One writes in French and one
				writes in English, therefore two contracts must be created. The company that offers CART, will sends a
				link for those that participate in the event via webcast (online), they can follow as well.</li>
			<li>Important to ensure that you discuss the possibility of having transcripts from the Communication Access
				Real-Time (CART) provider. Transcripts can be a valuable additional service for people with hearing loss
				(there is typically no additional cost for transcripts). However, if you want to share the transcripts
				with others, then the CART providers will charge an additional cost because they correct errors the CART
				stenographer may have made. Unfortunately, if the additional cost for transcripts is not paid, the CART
				user cannot share the transcripts with others.&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Sign Language Interpreters</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>SLI are booked through the Translation Bureau at Public Services and Procurement Canada (no cost, some
				exceptions) however, there may be cancellation fees.</li>
			<li>Notice of at least <strong>two full working days </strong>must be provided if all or part of the event
				is cancelled or the dates or times are changed to avoid the Bureau charging for the interpreters&rsquo;
				fees.</li>
			<li>These are booked as soon as possible, with at minimum 5 business days advance to ensure availability of
				interpreters.</li>
			<li>You can book the Sign Language interpreter by visiting the Translation Bureau&rsquo;s site <a
					href="http://gcintranet.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/bt-tb/interpretation/visuelle-visual-eng.html">Sign
					language interpretation and oral transliteration services <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i><span class="wb-inv">
						Internal link</span></a>.</li>
