		<h2>General team/project meeting</h2>
		<h3>Internal only</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Recommendation: <strong>MS Teams</strong></li>
			<li>Apply all accessibility features necessary based on known audience or accommodation requests were done
				ahead of time.</li>
			<li>This is a typical meeting for a team (usually less than 25 participants and all accommodations are known
				ahead of time)</li>
			<li>This scenario is most likely 95%+ of all meetings held at ESDC</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Internal and external &ndash; No protected information</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Recommendation: <strong>MS Teams (recommended) or Zoom</strong></li>
			<li>Apply all accessibility features necessary based on known audience AND accommodation requests are done
				ahead of time</li>
			<li><strong>Zoom</strong> could also be used in this case depending on a variety of factors (amount of
				external participants and accommodation requests)</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Internal and external &ndash; Protected information</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Recommendation: <strong>MS Teams</strong></li>
			<li>Apply all accessibility features necessary based on known audience AND accommodation requests were done

		<h2>All-staff meeting</h2>
		<h3>Internal and audience known</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Recommendation: <strong>MS Teams</strong></li>
			<li>Apply all accessibility features necessary based on known audience AND accommodation requests were done
				ahead of time</li>
			<li>If all-staff meeting is bilingual or French then CART will be required</li>
			<li>Depending on accommodation responses then CART and/or Sign Language Interpretation (SLI) may be required
			</li>
			<li>If SLI is required then switch to <strong>Zoom</strong> if no protected information. If protected
				information then ensure SLI workaround is in place prior to meeting.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>SLI workaround for MS Teams is to ensure the required attendees have two devices to connect to the
					meeting, one to view the presentation, and one dedicated view for the SLI.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h2>Special event</h2>
		<h3>Internal - up to 325 participants</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Recommendation: <strong>MS Teams</strong></li>
			<li>Ensure that accommodation requests are done ahead of time</li>
